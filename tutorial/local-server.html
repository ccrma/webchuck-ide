    WebChucK Tutorials, by Mike Mulshine et al

    Praise be to Jack Atherton for making ChucK work on the web... As well as getting Ace to work as a miniAudicle like IDE. WOW.
    
    Praise be to Matt Wright for suggesting the use of pandoc = markdown to html converter, in which we can embed html/js as well.

    Praise of course to Ge Wang for writing ChucK.
